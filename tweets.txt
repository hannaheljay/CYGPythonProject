I hate seeing blown up tweets too late. I LOVE dropping just a LITTLE bit of knowledge for ALL the masses to see on a tweet before it blows up. I dont want clout, just to exchange knowledge and begin to advance humanity baby steps at a time.
Please do not miss every chance to love them up, down, left, right, foward &amp; get each other’s back!
